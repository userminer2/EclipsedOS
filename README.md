# **About EclipsedOS:**


EclipsedOS is a linux distro made to run on low end devices (chrome devices should run this operating system well).

    (If there is a link there are no new releases but if there is a question mark then a new release is being compiled).
    (if there is a question mark in front of a known issue then it has not been confirmed yet).
    (Chromebook support is not guarenteed).
